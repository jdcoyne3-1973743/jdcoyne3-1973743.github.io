<p>
This is my first paragraph that I am writing. As you can see this is in the original times
new roman font. I find it very interesting that while this is the font preferred by most professors
at the UW, there is zero document writing software that has it as it's default font. Google drive is 
arial, I'm not sure what Word's is. I recently downloaded Microsoft One Note to assist with my 
school note-taking and not even that is in Times New Roman.

This second paragraph I was feeling to go with copperplate as my font. Its very unique and 
covers a large area. I also floated my image so that it is on the left side of the page. This will 
make it easier to read and the layout much more efficient with the space. The picture has also been
reduced to 50px.
