	<h1>JD Coyne</h1>
	<p> My name is JD Coyne and I am learning the different tags in html <br> I just used a line break tag to start
	a new line. Sometimes  I want my writing to sound angry so i use a <b> bold tag </b>. Sometimes I like
	to inspire people so I use a blockquote tag to spread words of wisdom. 
	
	<blockquote cite="Abraham Lincoln">
"In the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years" - Abraham Lincoln
</blockquote>

Sometimes italicized words look cool so i do that using the <i> italics tag </i>. Or maybe I would 
like to spice things up with an underline using the <u> underline tag </u>.
